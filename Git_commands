Create a new branch using Terminal
Open Terminal in RStudio (bottom left) and run:
git checkout -b new-branch-name
Example:
git checkout -b feature-clean-data
This does two things:
creates the branch
switches to it
Then push it to GitHub:
git push -u origin feature-clean-data

*********

How to confirm you’re now on the new branch
git branch
You’ll see:
  main
* feature-clean-data
The * shows the current branch.
Or using RStudio Git pane — the branch name will show on the dropdown.
********
PUSH a FILE to GIT LOCAL
METHOD 1 — Use the RStudio Git pane (easiest)
Save your new file in RStudio.
Go to the Git pane (top right).
You will see your new file listed with a yellow “?” (untracked file).
Tick the checkbox next to the file → it becomes staged.
Click Commit.
A window opens:
Write a commit message, e.g.
Add new script/file
Click Commit.
After committing, click Push (up arrow in the Git pane).
Done. Your file is now on GitHub.
********
PUSH TO REMOTE

git push origin branchname


********
1. Delete a LOCAL branch
First, switch to another branch (e.g., main), because you cannot delete the branch you are on:
git checkout main
Then delete the local branch:
git branch -d branchname
Use -D (capital D) if Git refuses because it’s not merged:
git branch -D branchname
✅ 2. Delete a REMOTE branch on GitHub
git push origin --delete branchname
or the older syntax (still works):
git push origin :branchname
🔍 Confirm deletion
Local:
git branch
You should not see the branch anymore.
Remote:
git branch -r
Or check on GitHub → "Branches" tab.
